## Introduction

This project aims to explore different types of machine learning models:

1. **Regression Models**: Various regression techniques are analyzed, including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Implemented for image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset.
3. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)**: Used for sequence prediction tasks such as time series forecasting.

## Regression Models

### Overview
Regression models are used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables. The following regression techniques were implemented:

1. **Linear Regression**: Simple and multiple linear regression techniques are used to model relationships between variables.
2. **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data.
3. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses support vector machines for regression tasks.
4. **Decision Tree Regression**: Uses decision tree algorithms to predict outcomes.
5. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
6. **Ridge Regression**: A type of linear regression that includes L2 regularization.
7. **Lasso Regression**: A type of linear regression that includes L1 regularization.

### Key Features
- Comparison of different regression techniques based on performance metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

### Overview
CNNs are designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They consist of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

### Implementation
A simple CNN was implemented using Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### Key Components
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from input images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality while retaining important features.
- **Activation Functions**: Introduce non-linearity into the model.

## Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

### Overview
LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network designed to learn long-term dependencies in sequential data.

### Implementation
A simple LSTM model was implemented for time series forecasting using synthetic sine wave data.

### Key Components
- **Memory Cells**: Store information over time.
- **Gates**: Control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell (input gate, forget gate, output gate).
